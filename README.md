ðŸ“Œ **Note:** You can obtain your Mockaroo API key by signing up at [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

## **Directory Structure**

When using Smock-It, the following directories are automatically created in your current working directory (if they donâ€™t already exist). These directories help organize your test data, making it easier to manage and reuse:

* **`data_gen/`** â€“ The root directory where all Smock-It generated test data is stored. It acts as the primary workspace for data generation.  
  * **`templates/`** â€“ Contains data templates that define field structures, relationships, and constraints, ensuring test data aligns with Salesforce schema requirements.

  * **`output/`** â€“ The output directory stores generated test data files and record insertion details, making it easy to track or reuse datasets later.

## Template structure

The ```sf template init``` command generates a data template based on the values provided in the questionnaire.
> Please refer [INIT_QUESTIONNAIRE_GUIDE.MD](https://github.com/concretios/smock-it/blob/main/INIT_QUESTIONNAIRE.MD) for more detail.

```json
{
  "templateFileName": "default_data_template.json",
  "namespaceToExclude": [],
  "outputFormat": ["csv"],
  "language": "en",
  "count": 1,
  "sObjects": [
    { "account": {} },
    { "contact": {} },
    {
      "lead": {
        "language": "en",
        "count": 5,
        "fieldsToExclude": ["fax", "website"],
        "fieldsToConsider": {
          "country": ["India", "USA"], 
          "dp-year__c": ["2024"], 
          "dp-month__c": ["March"],
          "email": []
        },
        "pickLeftFields": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
> For more on Template Use Cases, Please refer - **[USECASE.md](https://github.com/concretios/smock-it/blob/main/USECASE.md)**

### Field Instructions (for Template)

* Fax & Website: These fields are excluded from data generation, meaning no values will be created for them.

* Country: Data will be generated only for India and the USA. No other country values will be included.

* Email: Since no specific values are provided, random email addresses will be automatically generated.

* dp-Year\_\_c: This serves as a controlling field (parent) for a dependent picklist. It will always have a fixed value of 2024 during data generation.

* dp-Month\_\_c: A dependent field linked to `dp-Year__c`. It will always generate the value "March", with no variations.

* Dependent Picklists: The order of dependent picklists is important. The controlling field (`dp-Year__c`) must be listed before the dependent field (`dp-Month__c`) in the template.

* Field Prefix: Fields that are part of a dependent picklist must begin with the prefix `dp-`.

* `dp-` Fields: Fields with the `dp-` prefix must either be left empty or have a single predefined value. Multiple values are not supported.

## Commands 



#### **  Initialize Template**

 This command initializes a new data generation template. It sets up the required directory structure, prompts for a valid template file name, and collects configuration details for Salesforce objects (such as fields to exclude and record counts). Once all necessary inputs are gathered, the configuration undergoes validation against the org before being saved to a JSON file.

```
sf template init [--default]
```

#### ** 2.Upsert Configurations**

The Upsert command allows users to modify or add configurations to an existing data generation template. Users can specify details such as Salesforce object, language, record count, excluded fields, and output format. If the specified object does not already exist in the template, the command will prompt users to add it.

```
sf template upsert -t <templateFileName> [-s <sObject>] [-l <languageCode>] [-c <recordCount>] [-x <namespaceToExclude>] [-f <outputFormat>] [-e <fieldsToExclude>] [-i <fieldsToConsider>] [-p <pickLeftFields>]
```

#### **Remove Configurations**

Remove specific configurations from an existing data generation template using the remove command. Users can remove record count, language, namespaces, output format, and excluded fields. 

>**Note**: While these options offer flexibility, record count and language cannot be removed globally, and at least one output format must remain to ensure proper functionality

```
sf template remove -t <templateFileName> [-s <sObject>] [-l <languageCode>] [-c <recordCount>] [-x <namespaceToExclude>] [-f <outputFormat>] [-e <fieldsToExclude>] [-i <fieldsToConsider>] [-p <pickLeftFields>]
```

#### **Validate Template**

The validate command validates a data generation template file, ensuring that it is correctly configured for Salesforce. It checks the template for correctness, connects to Salesforce (using environment variables for credentials), and logs any warnings or errors found in the template's configuration. This step ensures that all objects, fields, and settings are properly defined before use. 

>**Note**: To execute this command, the user will need to mention the alias name or username of the Salesforce Org.

```
sf template validate -t <templateFileName> -a <aliasorUsername>
```

#### **Generate Data**

The generate command reads a Salesforce data generation template and generates data based on the objects and settings defined within it. It also excludes the fields from the data template file that have been specified, ensuring that unwanted fields are omitted from the generated records. This command is designed to facilitate the creation of tailored datasets for Salesforce objects. 

>**Note**: To execute this command, the user will need to mention the alias name or username of the Salesforce Org.

```
sf data generate -t <templateFileName> -a <aliasorUsername>
```

#### **Print Template**

The print command retrieves and displays the contents of a specified Salesforce data generation template. It is useful for reviewing the configuration before using it to generate data.

```
sf template print -t <templateFileName>
```
